                        <hr>
                        <p>&ldquo;I grew up with a lot of insecurities, a lot of self esteem issues. When I got into drugs and alcohol my life took a downward spiral. I ended up in a couple of dark places â€“ on the streets and in jail. But in jail I started to lift weights. It was the first thing that made me feel good about myself. I went to college to become a personal trainer because I wanted to give other people that feeling. Since then I created One Academy- a group of like-minded people who came together to challenge ourselves, set goals, and overcome obstacles. I want to give people a family. I want to give people a team. Everyone has a different kind of strength: emotional, physical, and mental. One Academy taps into those strengths. We&rsquo;re encouraging people to try something they&rsquo;ve never done before. It&rsquo;s an empowering experience inspiring other people.&rdquo;</p>
